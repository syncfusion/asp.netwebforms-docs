Essential ASP.NET ProgressBar control is a [graphical control element](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graphical_control_element) 
used to visualize the changing status of an extended operation. ProgressBar provides an interactive way to display the

* Theme - ProgressBar control consists of 12 built-in themes (6 metro and 6 gradient effects), and also supports custom skins to set user-defined themes.
