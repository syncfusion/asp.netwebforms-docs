# Animation

The animation option makes the pointer to rotate from minimum value to actual value with animation effects. This option can be enabled/disabled by using the `EnableAnimation` property. The speed of the pointer can be controlled by using the `AnimationSpeed` property. The time is represented in milliseconds.
