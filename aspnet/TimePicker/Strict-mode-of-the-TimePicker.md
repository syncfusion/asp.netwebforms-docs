# Strict mode of the TimePicker

TimePicker control provides you an option to set default value when there is no default value between minTime and maxTime by using **EnableStrictMode property**.

## StrictMode property

The following code explains you how to use the strict mode property.



{% highlight html %}

<ej:TimePicker ID="time" Value="09:00 AM" EnableStrictMode="true" MinTime="10:00 AM" MaxTime="09:00 PM" runat="server"></ej:TimePicker>

{% endhighlight %}
