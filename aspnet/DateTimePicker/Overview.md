# Overview

The **Essential ASP.NET DateTimePicker** control is used to input the date and time with a specific format. The **DateTimePicker** control combines the DatePicker and TimePicker controls so that you can select the date and time with your desired format.

## Key Features

* **DateTime format:** Supports all valid date and time formats.
* **Localization:** Supports localization of different cultures.
* **Persist:** Supports state maintenance during page refresh.
* **RTL:** Supports Right to Left alignment of content in the DateTimePicker control.
* **Themes:** Essential JavaScript controls consist of 12 built-in themes (6 – flat and 6 – gradient effects), and also support custom skin options to set user-defined themes.


N> As the DateTimePicker inherits the functionalities of the DatePicker and TimePicker controls, it supports the basic functionalities of both the controls.
