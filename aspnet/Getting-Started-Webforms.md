# Getting Started

> Starting with v16.2.0.x, if you reference Syncfusion assemblies from trial setup or from the NuGet feed, you also have to include a license key in your projects. Please refer to this [link](https://help.syncfusion.com/common/essential-studio/licensing/license-key) to know about registering Syncfusion license key in your ASP.NET application to use our components.

This section describes how to configure the Syncfusion ASP.NET components into the ASP.NET applications. There are three ways for embedding our controls into ASP.NET application:
1. [Using Syncfusion Project Template](https://help.syncfusion.com/aspnet/visual-studio-integration/visual-studio-extensions/create-project)
2. [Through Syncfusion NuGet Packages](https://help.syncfusion.com/aspnet/visual-studio-integration/nuget-packages)
3. [Through Manual Integration into the new/existing Application](https://help.syncfusion.com/aspnet/getting-started/manual-integration-of-syncfusion-aspnet-controls)

The procedure that are followed in manual integration process is entirely automated when creating an application using Syncfusion Project template.
