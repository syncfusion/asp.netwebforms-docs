# Overview

The ComboBox component allows the user to type a value or choose an option from the list of predefined options. When an arrow icon accompanied with this component is pressed, the dropdown displays a list of values, from which the user can select one.

## Key features

* [Data binding](https://help.syncfusion.com/aspnet/combobox/databinding) - Allows binding and accessing the list of items from local or server-side data source.

* [Custom values](https://help.syncfusion.com/aspnet/combobox/getting-started#custom-values) - Allows setting user-defined values that is not in the popup list.

* [Filtering](https://help.syncfusion.com/aspnet/combobox/filtering) - Allows filtering of list items based on a character typed in the component.
