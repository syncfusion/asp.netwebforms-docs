## Theme

TimePicker controlâ€™s style and appearance are controlled based on CSS classes. In order to apply Theme to the DatePicker control, you can refer to 2 files namely, ej.widgets.core.min.css and ej.theme.min.css. When the file ej.widgets.all.min.css is referred, then it is not necessary to include the files ej.widgets.core.min.css and ej.theme.min.css in your project, as ej.widgets.all.min.css is the combination of these both. 

By default, there are 13 themes support available for the TimePicker control namely,

* default-theme
* flat-azure-dark
* fat-lime
* flat-lime-dark
* flat-saffron
* flat-saffron-dark
* gradient-azure
* gradient-azure-dark
* gradient-lime
* gradient-lime-dark
* gradient-saffron
* gradient-saffron-dark
* bootstrap-theme



## CSS Class

To apply custom styles to your TimePicker control, you can specify **CssClass property**. The specified CSS name is added in the root of the TimePicker control.

The following code example renders the TimePicker control with the customized style.



{% highlight html %}

<ej:TimePicker ID="timepicker" runat="server" CssClass="custom"></ej: TimePicker>

{% endhighlight %}





Add the following customized style in a page. In the following CSS style, exiting theme style overrides by using root class custom.

{% highlight css %}

.custom  .e-active {

  background-color: #293CB4;

}

{% endhighlight %}
