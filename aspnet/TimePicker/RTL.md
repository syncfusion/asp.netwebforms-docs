# RTL

This feature supports to change the left-to-right alignment of the TimePicker control to right-to-left (RTL). The custom template TimePicker also supports RTL.

## Enable Right-To-Left Support

In the ASPX page, include the following TimePicker control and configure the EnableRTL property.

{% highlight html %}

<ej:TimePicker ID="time" EnableRTL="true" runat="server"></ej:TimePicker>

{% endhighlight %}

The following screenshot illustrates a TimePicker control whenEnableRTL is set to true.
